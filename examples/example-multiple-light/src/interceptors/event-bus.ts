/**
 * Batched event processor for using composable interceptors for event
 * handling and side effects to execute the result of handled events.
 *
 * Events processed by this class are simple 2-element tuples/arrays of
 * this form: `["event-id", payload?]`, where the `payload` is optional
 * and can be of any type.
 *
 * Events are processed by registered handlers which transform each
 * event into a number of side effect descriptions to be executed later.
 * This separation ensures event handlers themselves are pure functions
 * and leads to more efficient reuse of side effecting operations. The
 * pure data nature until the last stage of processing (the application
 * side effects) too means that event flow can be much easier inspected
 * and debugged.
 *
 * In this model a single event handler itself is an array of objects
 * with `pre` and/or `post` keys and functions attached to each key.
 * These functions are called interceptors, since each intercepts the
 * processing of an event and can contribute their own side effects.
 * Each event's interceptor chain is processed bi-directionally (`pre`
 * in forward, `post` in reverse order) and the effects returned from
 * each interceptor are merged/collected. The outcome of this setup is a
 * more aspect-oriented, composable approach to event handling and
 * allows to inject common, re-usable behaviors for multiple event types
 * (logging, validation, undo/redo triggers etc.).
 *
 * Side effects are only processed after all event handlers have run.
 * Furthermore, their order of execution can be configured with optional
 * priorities.
 *
 * See for further details:
 *
 * - `processQueue()`
 * - `processEvent()`
 * - `processEffects()`
 * - `mergeEffects()`
 *
 * The overall approach of this type of event processing is heavily
 * based on the pattern initially pioneered by @Day8/re-frame, with the
 * following differences:
 *
 * - stateless (see `EventBus` for the more common stateful alternative)
 * - standalone implementation (no assumptions about surrounding
 *   context/framework)
 * - manual control over event queue processing
 * - supports event cancellation (via FX_CANCEL side effect)
 * - side effect collection (multiple side effects for same effect type
 *   per frame)
 * - side effect priorities (to control execution order)
 * - dynamic addition/removal of handlers & effects

   *
   * #### `FX_CANCEL`

   *
   * #### `FX_DISPATCH`
   *
   * Dispatches assigned events to be processed in next frame.
   *
   * #### `FX_DISPATCH_ASYNC`
   *
   * Async wrapper for promise based side effects.
   *
   * #### `FX_DISPATCH_NOW`
   *
   * Dispatches assigned events as part of currently processed event
   * queue (no delay).
   *
   * #### `FX_DELAY`
   *
   * Async side effect. Only to be used in conjunction with
   * `FX_DISPATCH_ASYNC`. Triggers given event after `x` milliseconds.
   *
   * ```
   * // this triggers `[EV_SUCCESS, "ok"]` event after 1000 ms
   * { [FX_DISPATCH_ASYNC]: [FX_DELAY, [1000, "ok"], EV_SUCCESS, EV_ERROR] }
   * ```
   *
   * #### `FX_FETCH`
   *
   * Async side effect. Only to be used in conjunction with
   * `FX_DISPATCH_ASYNC`. Performs `fetch()` HTTP request and triggers
   * success with received response, or if there was an error with
   * response's `statusText`. The error event is only triggered if the
   * fetched response's `ok` field is non-truthy.

   * ```
   * [EV_UPDATE_VALUE, ["path.to.value", (x, y) => x + y, 1]]

   * #### `EV_TOGGLE_VALUE`

   * Negates a boolean state value at given path.
   *
   * Example event definition:
   * ```
   * [EV_TOGGLE_VALUE, "path.to.value"]
   * ```
   *
   * #### `EV_UNDO`
   *
   * Calls `ctx[id].undo()` and uses return value as new state.
   * Assumes `ctx[id]` is a @thi.ng/atom `History` instance, provided
   * via e.g. `processQueue({ history })`. The event can be triggered
   * with or without ID. By default `"history"` is used as default key
   * to lookup the `History` instance. Furthermore, an additional
   * event can be triggered based on if a previous state has been
   * restored or not (basically, if the undo was successful). This is
   * useful for resetting/re-initializing stateful resources after a
   * successful undo action or to notify the user that no more undo's
   * are possible. The new event will be processed in the same frame
   * and has access to the (possibly) restored state. The event
   * structure for these options is shown below:
   *
   * ```
   * // using default ID
   * bus.dispatch([EV_UNDO]);
   *
   * // using custom history ID
   * bus.dispatch([EV_UNDO, ["custom"]]);
   *
   * // using custom ID and dispatch another event after undo
   * bus.dispatch([EV_UNDO, ["custom", ["ev-undo-success"], ["ev-undo-fail"]]]);
   * ```
   *
   * #### `EV_REDO`
   *
   * Similar to `EV_UNDO`, but for redo actions.
   *
   * ### Side effects
   *
   * #### `FX_STATE`
   *
   * Resets state atom to provided value (only a single update per
   * processing frame).
